## Description:
The implementation of the snake game in a console environment. I did it so simply, to warm up, to remember C#. The game code is simple, without the use of OOP (except for small structures and enums). I used .Net7. I programmed from Linux in Visual Studio Code.

### Project Features:
* C# .Net7;
* No OOP;
* Console shell pseudo graphics;
